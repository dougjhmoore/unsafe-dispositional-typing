DISPOSITIONAL TYPING EMPIRICAL RESULTS
=====================================
Dataset: LLVM Test Suite Analysis
Analysis Date: June 2025
Functions Analyzed: 202

Key Findings:
- Successfully distinguished safe vs unsafe code patterns
- Analyzed functions ranging from trivial (0 edges) to highly complex (567+ edges)
- Demonstrated scalability on real-world systems programming code
- Validated theoretical ε-i-j-η algebra on concrete examples

This represents the first large-scale empirical validation of dispositional typing theory.
